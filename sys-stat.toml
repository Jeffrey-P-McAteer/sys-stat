[general]
# This program is run whenever a [[sys]] is checked and the status is different from before.
# A simple template language is supported, such that several constants get replaced
# when used in any string in the command array:
#  {name} = the name section from the [[sys]] block
#  {status} = either "good" or "bad". In the future we may also report a "degraded" state.
#  {reason} = any details known about what occurred, for example an http endpoint may report "returned 404 when"
on_status_change = [
  "notify-send", "sys {name} is now {status} because {reason}'",
]
# This program is run after on_status_change when {status} == "good"
on_status_good = [
  "notify-send", "sys {name} has resumed.",
]
# This program is run after on_status_change when {status} == "bad"
on_status_bad = [
  "notify-send", "sys {name} has failed!",
]
# While running sys-stat prints events to this file in CSV format.
# The plan is to provide details such as sys latency which can then
# be graphed to discover when systems are likely to break and if they are
# nearing capacity limits.
# Format is:
#  timestamp, service name, status (true/false), latency (milliseconds)
log_file = "/tmp/status.csv"


# Each [[sys]] block is required to have:
#  - name - a unique name for the sys
#  - uri - an http, https, or ftp url.
#          More protocols will be added later, but this must
#          describe the host and connection details.
# 
# The rest are optional and default to empty strings or some sane default value
